## Christmas in Hong Kong by Danielle Fong 

In 2002, I got on a plane and left Singapore on Christmas Day. Since then, for the past seventeen years, I have been celebrating a cold, winter Christmas in Hong Kong. 

I love Christmas, and I love it even more after becoming a parent. It makes the celebration more meaningful with our children. My husband wants our daughter to believe that Santa is real, so it became a “tradition” for her to place her letter for Santa, accompanied by cookies and milk, on every Christmas Eve.

That same night, we would place all the presents under the tree and told her Santa visited and dropped off the gifts while she was sleeping. She is thirteen now, and we secretly believe she knows Santa is not real anymore, but she plays along so that she doesn’t ruin it for her little brother.

On Christmas day, my husband will prepare a feast for us. Roast beef, roast potatoes and Christmas pudding are a must-have during dinner. Christmas crackers and games too!

This year, our almost four-year-old son is sensible enough to help decorate our faithful, twelve-year-old Christmas tree instead of destroying it. It is such a joy to see two kids in our home, soaking into the Christmas spirit and enjoying this festive season. Of course, our son is starting to believe in Santa as well.

## My Best Last Christmas by Eve Wee-Ang

Having lived in Shanghai for ten years, my family has visited me countless times. Each time they visit us, I always try my best to provide them with new experiences.

With three birthday celebrations in a row – my sister’s, my husband’s and my daughter’s – December is a fun party month for my whole family. Adding Christmas into the mix, we always have a reason to celebrate.

Last Christmas, my family from Singapore visited us again in Shanghai. It was a party of six that included my sister’s family, my aunt and my mother. Everyone stayed at our house, so you can imagine the ruckus we caused!

_A month filled with birthdays and celebrations!_

My family took the opportunity to sleep in a lot! Our favourite activity is curling up at home and catching up with each other over a cup of my mother’s famous kopi brewed with coffee beans that she hand-carried from the wet market. One of the most memorable moments was when it snowed last year (It rarely snows in Shanghai!) and my family went absolutely bonkers out of excitement!

Like every typical Singaporean household, food rules. Weeks before she visited us in Shanghai, my mother had begun filling up her luggage with our favourite foods from home. She was the true Santa Claus, as she unveiled packets of Irvin’s Salted Egg Fish Skin, Ah Seng’s durian, Milo Australian Recipe refill packs and of course, the fresh yellow noodles which I insist have a uniquely Singaporean texture that can’t be found anywhere in Shanghai. With these bounties, I cooked up a Christmas feast that was a rojak of Southeast Asian and Western dishes.

On the last night, the kids and I decided to put up a rock concert at home. I was the lead singer and my 5-year-old niece was my backup with her new Christmas present - an electric guitar. To pay homage to my family, I crooned like an aging rocker with a bad throat as I summarized the highlights of their trip in my songs. Everyone rolled on the floor and laughed till their bellies hurt. My mother, as usual, was the loudest of the pack. She didn’t just laugh, she roared. It was one of the happiest moments of my life.

_With my stylish extraordinary mum, who was my biggest inspiration in life_

A month ago, my beloved mother passed away. She was cycling to the wet market and got hit by a van. I was in Shanghai when I received the devastating news, so I asked my brother-in-law to place the phone on her ear. She was already unconscious, but I told her I love her very much and asked her to wait for me to come home. However, minutes later, my mother left us. I was the last person who spoke to her. 

With the holidays approaching this year, even though I am still struggling to make sense of her passing, I am comforted that we spent our best last Christmas together in Shanghai.

## Christmas in New Zealand by Pang Hong Mei 

Christmas in the heart of New Zealand unofficially begins when the two big Pohutukawa trees outside Wellington Railway Station blossom with bright red flowers. That’s why they are also known as New Zealand Christmas trees! It’s an indication that summer is finally here, and the weather is beginning to warm up. Cookie Time sellers start popping up around town with buckets of Christmas cookies. Iʼve always distracted myself from the temptation to buy one by rushing off to catch the train home.

There’s always something to do in New Zealand during the days leading up to Christmas. One year, Rui and I checked out the Santa parade in town. Another year, we went around the neighbourhood at night to see the lights done up by different households.

Christmas is all about traditions and we have our own. While the locals spend Christmas catching up with their family over the barbie and a few beers, Rui and I pack our bags, clip on the reindeer ears and nose on the car and go on our annual summer roadie. 

I check the weather forecast constantly while Rui keeps an eye on the road. We plan as we go; with nothing booked despite knowing it’s the busy holiday period. If it’s forecast to rain, we search for sheltered accommodation; if the weather is fine, we carry on camping. We enjoy the freedom so much we don’t mind dealing with the uncertainty of having nowhere to stay or shower. Fortunately, it’s never happened before and most years, we spend Christmas Eve sleeping in a hut with strangers!

_At Rob Roy Glacier Track in 2018!_

The following day, on Christmas, we go for long walks in the mountains, exchanging Christmas greetings with those we meet on the track. During those hours, I would reflect on the past year and wonder whether (or when!) we should go back home to Singapore. More often than not, I lose track of time and always find it fascinating that I’ve walked for so long.

After walking for 3 to 4 days in the wilderness, we would reward ourselves with a nice meal, hot shower and of course Wi-Fi. By the time we get back to civilisation and see a Christmas tree, however, Christmas is already over!
