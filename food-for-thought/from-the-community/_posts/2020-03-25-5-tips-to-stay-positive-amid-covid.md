_As we live through this unprecedented time of challenge and disruption, one can feel isolated and slide into despair. It is thus extremely important to maintain a positive mindset and remind yourself that life will return to normal. Here are a few tips that we hope will help you navigate this situation!_

#### 1) Spend time with your loved ones and friends (virtually)

Social distancing doesn’t mean social isolation. Take time to call family and friends, check in on them and remind them that you’re thinking of them. Create an [online social life](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/technology/coronavirus-how-to-live-online.html) by setting up a virtual group with friends or workmates. Schedule virtual coffee dates or lunches. Attend group webinars (Singapore Connect is running a [series of webinars on Sundays](https://www.facebook.com/singaporeconnect/posts/2653180368236413)) to share tips and information updates on the coronavirus or industry- and work-related updates. 

Be disciplined with your time online. Check news or social media only a few times a day to get the news updates then shut it off. You don’t need constant stress from live newsfeeds. 

#### 2) Boost your immune system

Your immune system is the last line of defence so take good care of yourself – keep a good diet, take Vitamin C, and ditch sugars / processed foods. 

Make sure you keep moving! Gyms are closed but there are many alternative home exercises available. Bodyweight options by [POPSUGAR Fitness](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBINFWq52ShSgUFEoynfSwg) or perhaps you prefer [Le Mill’s Bodycombat Invincible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAb2Z1dEN90). There are also tons of stories of friends turning on the web camera and working out together! 

#### 3)	Work effectively from home 

Working from home presents its own set of challenges. It’s important to stick to a daily routine. Get that morning coffee, shower and change into regular clothes instead of lounging around in your PJs. Set your mind right. 

Entrepreneur has a great article with [12 tips to stay healthy while working from home](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/243589) while CNA Lifestyle offers [7 handy productivity apps](https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/trending/work-from-home-tech-apps-tips-productive-12541486) to make life easier.  LinkedIn also chimes in with a course on [how to set yourself and your teams up for success](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/remote-working-setting-yourself-and-your-teams-up-for-success) working remotely. 

#### 4)	Keep the kids engaged

We understand that it’s more stressful if you have children that need care or are trying to attend online classes. Buzzfeed has an article on how other parents are coping and some tips with a reminder that if you feel overwhelmed, it’s normal, others are feeling it too.

On the other hand, if you think you need advice on how to talk with your kids about coronavirus and why they have to stay at home, try this LyraHealth blogpost on how to support kids in this time.

A few activities to keep your children engaged: 
- Scholastic has created a [free learn-from-home site with 20+ days of learning and activities](https://classroommagazines.scholastic.com/support/learnathome.html) or check in on this [homeschool curriculum](https://allinonehomeschool.com/) which also has a list of [thinking games by grade](https://allinonehomeschool.com/thinking/).
- Pretend to travel the world or visit a zoo. Go on a [virtual tour of these 12 famous museums](https://www.travelandleisure.com/attractions/museums-galleries/museums-with-virtual-tours) or visit the [San Diego Zoo](https://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/live-cams?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9tbzBRDVARIsAMBplx8msQZza3BGs0nEjrYVaImHiUoIeJQg9imblgvfNQ1tgG02Lo3tb2UaAr5JEALw_wcB) via LiveCam.

#### 5)	Find time for yourself 

Above all else, remember to practise patience and kindness with those at home, including yourself! Find “me-time” to rejuvenate and restore yourself, whether it is a relaxing breakfast or a home spa.  

You can also take a break by remembering to do the things you love, whether by joining a book club, watching your favourite streaming programme or simply experimenting in the kitchen. This Guardian article has a bit of everything, but our favourite is probably the suggestion to [join a trashy book club](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-11-best-cultural-activities). 

Take the time to decompress and those around you will thank you for it.
