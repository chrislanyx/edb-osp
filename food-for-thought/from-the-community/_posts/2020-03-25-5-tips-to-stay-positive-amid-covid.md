It is thus extremely important to maintain a positive mindset and remind yourself that life will return to normal. Here are a few tips that we hope will help you navigate this situation!_

#### 1) 1.	Spend time with your loved ones and friends (virtually)

Social distancing doesn’t mean social isolation. Take time to call family and friends, check in on them and remind them that you’re thinking of them. Create an [online social life](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/technology/coronavirus-how-to-live-online.html) by setting up a virtual group with friends or workmates. Schedule virtual coffee dates or lunches. Attend group webinars (Singapore Connect is running a [series of webinars on Sundays](https://www.facebook.com/singaporeconnect/posts/2653180368236413)) to share tips and information updates on the coronavirus or industry- and work-related updates. 

Be disciplined with your time online. Check news or social media only a few times a day to get the news updates then shut it off. You don’t need constant stress from live newsfeeds. 

#### 2) Boost your immune system

Your immune system is the last line of defence so take good care of yourself – keep a good diet, take Vitamin C, and ditch sugars / processed foods. 

Make sure you keep moving! Gyms are closed but there are many alternative home exercises available. Bodyweight options by [POPSUGAR Fitness](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBINFWq52ShSgUFEoynfSwg) or perhaps you prefer [Le Mill’s Bodycombat Invincible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAb2Z1dEN90). There are also tons of stories of friends turning on the web camera and working out together! 

#### 3)	Work effectively from home 

Working from home presents its own set of challenges. It’s important to stick to a daily routine. Get that morning coffee, shower and change into regular clothes instead of lounging around in your PJs. Set your mind right.
