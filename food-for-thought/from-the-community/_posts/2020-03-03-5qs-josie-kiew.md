You might have run into Josie, a student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)'s Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, at one of our recent events. Based in Oakland, she is part of the Overseas Entrepreneurship Programme by NTU, where she is undertaking a 1-year internship at [Nona Lim](https://www.nonalim.com/). Her responsibilities include email marketing, website maintenance, and online orders. Back home, Josie lives in Joo Chiat Place with her parents, sister, and brother.

#### 1) My favourite activity/place in the Bay Area: 

My favourite place is Bay Street Emeryville which is a beautiful open street mall. It’s very different from malls in Singapore, which are indoors. Walking along the street, going from store to store and walking alongside the cars that are parked by the streets is definitely a different experience. It also has my favourite Trader Joe’s for great food, Target for essentials, and AMC, as I can’t live without movies.

#### 2) My favourite food in the Bay Area: 

I like SuperDuper burgers, and there are only a few outlets here in the Bay Area. The burgers are always so juicy, and their homemade pickles are mind-bogglingly delicious. I’ve never been the biggest fan of pickles, and this changed my mind. I guess you’ll always have to be open about things, and that one time is enough to make you love more stuff in your life!

#### 3) The most exciting part of my job:

As an intern, you worry about not doing enough. One thing about working at Nona Lim is there are always new things to learn and new challenges to face. Enough does not exist when working in a start-up! Every day is different.

#### 4) What I miss most about Singapore:

I miss the convenience! When you are hungry, there’s usually a coffee shop and a hawker centre nearby. And the variety - from Chinese to Indian, to Western. And chilli. I miss chili. There’s a type of chili for every dish, one for chicken rice, Nasi Lemak, and even wan tan mee. Eating wan tan mee or nasi lemak here is just not the same without the chili :( 


#### 5) 1 fun fact about me

I’ve dreamed about coming to work and experience living abroad in the US since I was nine. I kept my dreams close and found ways to achieve it even if I didn’t know where it would lead me. After all, if I didn’t try, I’ll never know. So now, I like to think I have two homes, one in Singapore and one in the US. I love them both, and both are great for different things.
