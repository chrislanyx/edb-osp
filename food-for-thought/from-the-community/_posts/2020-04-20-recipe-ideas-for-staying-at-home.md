1 tablespoon finely chopped Lemongrass
2 tablespoons minced Garlic
2 tablespoons Oil

**Instructions: **
1.	Mix sambal oelek, soy sauce, honey, fish sauce, lemongrass and garlic. 
2.	Add chicken pieces and marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.

### Recipe 2: Laksa Prawn Spaghetti (adapted from [Prima Taste](https://www.primataste.com/recipes/laksa-spaghetti))
6 deshelled Prawns 
320g cooked Spaghetti 
6g chopped Garlic 
2 tablespoons Oil
112g Cooking Cream
180ml Water 
Laksa Fried Rice Sauce (Prima Taste)
*This serves 3 people

**Instructions: **
1.	Heat oil on pan on medium heat and add garlic till aromatic. Mix in laksa fried rice sauce and stir-fry for 10 seconds.
2.	Add water and simmer for 30 seconds till fragrant.
3.	Add cooking cream, mix well and simmer for 30 seconds. Add prawns and simmer further.
4.	When prawns are almost cooked, add in cooked spaghetti and flip occasionally until the sauce lightly coats the spaghetti and is slightly thickened. 

### Recipe 3: 4-ingredient Brown Sugar Milk (recipe from Cooking In Chinglish)
3⁄4 cup Tapioca Flour (plus more for dusting)
5 tablespoons + 2 tablespoons Muscovado sugar (or dark brown sugar)
1⁄4 cup water
Milk

**Instructions:**
1.	Combine water and 5 tbsp of brown sugar in a pot and bring it to a boil. Stir occasionally to help the sugar to dissolve.
2.	Keep the pot on heat while adding about half of the tapioca flour in, stirring constantly until it forms a very sticky dough/paste.
3.	Remove the pan from the heat and add the rest of the tapioca flour, stir about 10 times and pour the mixture onto a working surface. Let the mixture cool till its warm. 
4.	Knead the dough until all flour is incorporated and form it into a ball. Tip: if its too dry, add a little bit of cold water; if it’s too wet, add more flour. 
5.	Form the dough into small balls about 1/3-inch diameter. Coat in a thin layer of flour to prevent sticking. 
6.	Sift dried boba and add into a pot of boiling water (use 10 times the volume of water to the volume of dried boba). Maintain a gentle boil and cook for 12-15 minutes until boba is 90% cooked through. Turn off heat and cover with a lid for 10 minutes. 
7.	Drain boba and rinse with cold water. Mix in 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and let cool. 
8.	Scoop boba into a cup and add milk and brown sugar to taste.
