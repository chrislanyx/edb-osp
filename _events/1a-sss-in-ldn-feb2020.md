In February, we had the pleasure of hosting the Chairman of Temasek Holdings, Mr Lim Boon Heng, in London where he spoke about lessons that can be learnt and applied in our health sector, about reinvention and rejuvenation in Singapore with projects like Jewel in Changi Airport and the Greater Southern Waterfront.

He also shared about people being at the centre of the country, and how companies that Temasek invests in are reskilling instead of retrenching their workers and how we need to find passion for life-long learning. 

We hope everyone enjoyed networking over a Singapore-style buffet that night! Here is a look at what went down:

### About the Singapore Speakers Series

The Singapore Speakers Series is a high-signature event aimed at fostering greater interaction between eminent Singapore-based leaders and the overseas Singaporean community residing in cities with significant pockets of overseas Singaporeans such as New York, London, Sydney, Melbourne, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The series will feature prominent Singapore business leaders from the private sector as well as distinguished public sector luminaries who have made significant contributions to Singapore's nation-building efforts. Through first-hand accounts of these top leaders, overseas Singaporeans can keep abreast of industry trends, developments in Singaporeâ€™s business and economic landscape and gain fresh insights on job and business opportunities back home.
