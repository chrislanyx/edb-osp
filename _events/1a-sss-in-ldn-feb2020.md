It was a really insightful session as he spoke about reinvention and new projects being built in Singapore, a necessity for us to remain competitive in today’s world of slowing growth and rising cost of living.

He also shared about people being at the centre of the country, and how companies that Temasek invests in are reskilling instead of retrenching their workers and how we need to find passion for life-long learning.
