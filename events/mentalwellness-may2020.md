Dr Jessie Chua (Senior Clinical Psychologist at Resilienz Clinic) will conduct an interactive workshop on ways to cope with the stress and anxiety caused by the COVID19 crisis. This session will shed light on Radical Acceptance, which means accepting everything about ourselves, our current situations, and our lives without resentment. This then allows us to apply wisdom in navigating change more effectively, empowering us to create a life that is worth living.
