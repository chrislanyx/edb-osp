#### Behind the Scenes: Join This Exclusive Conversation On Singapore's COVID-19 Response  
 
How did Singapore deal with COVID-19 crisis? What were the difficult behind-the-scenes conversations, driving decisions? What does the post-COVID era look like for Singapore? How prepared are we, as a country and a community, for the next pandemic?  
 
Answering these questions and more, SGN invites overseas Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents for an exclusive conversation with Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Communications and Information and Ministry of Transport.
