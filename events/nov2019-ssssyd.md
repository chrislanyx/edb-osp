### About the Singapore Speakers Series

The Singapore Speakers Series is a high-signature event aimed at fostering greater interaction between eminent Singapore-based leaders and the overseas Singaporean community residing in cities with significant pockets of overseas Singaporeans such as New York, London, Sydney, Melbourne, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The series will feature prominent Singapore business leaders from the private sector as well as distinguished public sector luminaries who have made significant contributions to Singapore's nation-building efforts. Through first-hand accounts of these top leaders, overseas Singaporeans can keep abreast of industry trends, developments in Singapore’s business and economic landscape and gain fresh insights on job and business opportunities back home.
