On 29 Nov, we had the pleasure of hosting the Executive Chairman of Banyan Tree Holdings Limited, Mr Ho Kwon Ping at our final Singapore Speakers Series event for the year, held in Shanghai.

He spoke about the emergence of China against the US, causing a realignment of civilisations and increased economic challenges between the two countries. In the same light, he discussed how Singaporeans should adopt a holistic approach towards conducting businesses, and be mindful not to take sides. Mr Ho also shared about how it may be beneficial for China to look beyond capital markets to boost its global standing.

### About the Singapore Speakers Series

The Singapore Speakers Series is a high-signature event aimed at fostering greater interaction between eminent Singapore-based leaders and the overseas Singaporean community residing in cities with significant pockets of overseas Singaporeans such as New York, London, Sydney, Melbourne, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The series will feature prominent Singapore business leaders from the private sector as well as distinguished public sector luminaries who have made significant contributions to Singapore's nation-building efforts. Through first-hand accounts of these top leaders, overseas Singaporeans can keep abreast of industry trends, developments in Singaporeâ€™s business and economic landscape and gain fresh insights on job and business opportunities back home.
