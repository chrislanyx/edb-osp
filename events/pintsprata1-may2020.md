Join us for the first in a series of meet-ups (F2F in London or virtual)! Each meet-up will be run fire-side chat style featuring trailblazers from Singapore or friends of Singapore. 

What's the name of this series you may ask. Well, we've decided to call it Pints and Prata (P&P) in honour our iconic favs from the UK (pints of beer) and SG (roti prata)! We were meant to kickoff the series with actual P&P for you but alas, we'll have to stick to a virtual session for now. More exciting P&Ps have been lined up. Akan datang!

**Pints and Prata #1 - Women in Tech**

For the inaugural P&P, SGN is partnering SYNC to bring to you two female trailblazers who thrive in their respective technology careers.  Our speaker Ms Jenny Chong is Head of Innovation and Data Analytics at KogoPay. Jenny will share about her personal career journey, views on agile leadership, what she believes are the critical factors for achieving success in management roles, challenges she has had to overcome and the barriers still in place which are impacting women and diversity in both tech and the financial sector. The webinar will be moderated by Ms Hooi Ren Yi, Director of Financial Inclusion at Railsbank.
