Are you ready for the largest code league organised by Shopee?

Shopee Code League is happening from 8 June to 1 August. We are calling out to all undergraduate students and professionals across the region to join us in a series of coding challenges and put your coding skills to the test. 

All you have to do is to form a team of 2-4 and be prepared to dive into real world problems ranging from data analytics to data science, specially designed by the Shopee tech teams. 

Are you up for the challenge to compete against coders across the region? Sign up here at [careers.shopee.sg/codeleague](https://careers.shopee.sg/codeleague/).

Mark your calendars and get ready to be a part of the coding event of the year!
