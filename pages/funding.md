Homesick? Missing the company of fellow Singaporeans? Want to organise events to galvanise the community? If you have an idea that will help to bring fellow Singaporeans closer together, we will be happy to support. You can make it happen through the Overseas Singaporean Funding Programme (OSFP). We provide seed funding for ground-up initiatives that promote a sense of community and connection to home.

## How to apply for Funding

1.  **Does your event meet the criteria?**
    
    Your ground-up initiatives, events or activities must meet the following criteria:
    * Celebrate Singapore’s culture and heritage;
    * Keep Singaporeans abroad abreast with developments in Singapore; and
    * Strengthen a sense of community amongst the Singaporeans abroad through meaningful projects and activities.
    
    Ground-up initiatives that meet more than one qualifying criteria may be funded up to 80% of the proposed event cost,
    while those that meet only one qualifying criterion may be funded up to 40% of the proposed event cost. Applicants must
    exercise fiscal prudence, avoid extravagant options and ensure that the proposed event costs are critical to the success
    of the ground-up initiatives. Total government funding (including funding via OSFP) cannot exceed 80% of the find
    expenditure.
    
    The ground-up initiatives must target a mainly Singaporean audience with a minimum group size of 50 Singaporeans.
    Successful applicants will be informed of the allocated amount, which is based on the number of criteria met, indicative
    number of Singaporean attendees and budget forecasts.
    
    Overseas Singaporean organisations (such as student associations, professional clubs, etc) or informal groups of
    Singaporeans abroad who wish to organise ground-up initiatives for their Singaporean communities may apply.
    
    
2.  **How long are applications opened for?**
    
    Applications are open throughout the year and must be submitted to the OSU **at least three weeks before the event.** To
    proceed, [apply online here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5d9ea77a4073c8001283331b).
    
    *Note: During application, applicants are to include expected income (if any) under sponsor list.*
    
    
3.  **Things to look out for**
   
    Ground-up initiatives that have already taken place or generate profits will **not** be eligible for funding. SGN's
    support should be acknowledged on all publicity materials, where possible, from date of award of the funding.
   
   
4.  **When will disbursement of funds take place?**

    It will take place after successful applicants have fulfilled the following requirements:
    
    **Pre-event**
    a) Publicise the event on the Overseas Singaporean Portal's calendaring tool at least three weeks before the event date.
    
    **Post-event**
    b) Post at least three photographs of the event on the Overseas Singaporean Facebook page together with a brief
    description of the event, and consent to the photos being used for OSU's publicity purposes. Click here for a guide on

    c) Log on to the Overseas Singaporean Portal and complete the Post Event Report with the following supporting documents
    within 2 months after the event ends.
    * Receipts of expenditures
    * Attendance list of all Singaporean attendees including full name, email address and profession (student, professional,
    others)
    * Completed GIRO Form.
    
    Disbursement of funds will be done via wire Bank transfer:
    
    * Incomplete details provided on the GIRO form may result in delays in disbursement of funds.
    * Applicants must also ensure that the bank account submitted is able to receive disbursement of funds in the currency
    stated in the funding application. OSU reserves the right to disburse the funds in an alternative currency based on the
    prevailing financial regulations.
    *Currency conversion is based on the exchange rate listed on the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s website on the day of   
    the event.
    * The final disbursement amount credited may be subjected to the prevailing currency exchange rate and admin fees imposed
    by the applicant’s bank. Any associated bank charges or fees incurred due to the disbursement will not be borne by OSU.
    
    *Note: Non-compliance with the terms and conditions for OSFP, including changes to eventual format of the ground-up
    initiative, expenditures, number of Singaporean attendees or late submission of post-event documents may result in
    reduction of the disbursement amount, delay in disbursement of funds or affect future applications under the OSFP.
