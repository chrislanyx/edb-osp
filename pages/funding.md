Homesick? Missing the company of fellow Singaporeans? Want to organise events to galvanise the community? If you have an idea that will help to bring fellow Singaporeans closer together, we will be happy to support. You can make it happen through the Overseas Singaporean Funding Programme (OSFP). We provide seed funding for ground-up initiatives that promote a sense of community and connection to home.

## How to apply for Funding

1.  **Does your event meet the criteria?**
    Your ground-up initiatives, events or activities must meet the following criteria:
    * Celebrate Singaporeâ€™s culture and heritage;
    * Keep Singaporeans abroad abreast with developments in Singapore; and
    * Strengthen a sense of community amongst the Singaporeans abroad through meaningful projects and activities.
    
    Ground-up initiatives that meet more than one qualifying criteria may be funded up to 80% of the proposed event cost,
    while those that meet only one qualifying criterion may be funded up to 40% of the proposed event cost. Applicants must
    exercise fiscal prudence, avoid extravagant options and ensure that the proposed event costs are critical to the success
    of the ground-up initiatives. Total government funding (including funding via OSFP) cannot exceed 80% of the find
    expenditure.
    
    The ground-up initiatives must target a mainly Singaporean audience with a minimum group size of 50 Singaporeans.
    Successful applicants will be informed of the allocated amount, which is based on the number of criteria met, indicative
    number of Singaporean attendees and budget forecasts.
    
    Overseas Singaporean organisations (such as student associations, professional clubs, etc) or informal groups of
    Singaporeans abroad who wish to organise ground-up initiatives for their Singaporean communities may apply.
    
2.  **How long are applications opened for?**
    
    Applications are open throughout the year and must be submitted to the OSU **at least three weeks before the event.** To
