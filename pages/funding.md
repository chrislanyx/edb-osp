Homesick? Missing the company of fellow Singaporeans? Want to organise events to galvanise the community? If you have an idea that will help to bring fellow Singaporeans closer together, we will be happy to support. You can make it happen through the Overseas Singaporean Funding Programme (OSFP). We provide seed funding for ground-up initiatives that promote a sense of community and connection to home.
