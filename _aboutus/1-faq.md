## **FAQ**

### Who is SGN and what does SGN do?

The Singapore Global Network (SGN) is a division in the Economic Development Board (EDB). The SGN will broaden and deepen our overseas networks, comprising Overseas Singaporeans as well as friends and fans of Singapore. 

### Overseas Singaporean Unit (OSU) is already engaging with overseas Singaporeans. As an overseas Singaporean, how does this affect me?

The Overseas Singaporean Unit has moved from MCCY to EDB to become part of SGN since 1 June 2019. 

The OSU joined SGN as part of the Government’s efforts to better coordinate, strengthen and expand Singapore’s connections with our global networks of Singaporeans and friends of Singapore living abroad. 

Overseas Singaporeans are an integral part of the Singapore family. Your engagement as an overseas Singaporean with us, remains a key priority for SGN’s engagement efforts, as we continue to help overseas Singaporeans remain connected home and build a strong and cohesive society.

For members who previously subscribed to Overseas Singaporean Unit’s e-newsletters, you will no longer be able to receive news, updates and event invitations from us after April 2020. Please subscribe with us at [https://go.gov.sg/sgnsignup](https://go.gov.sg/sgnsignup) to stay in the know. 

### Why do I need to sign up again, if I am already on the Overseas Singaporean Unit (OSU)'s mailing list?

Due to data and privacy regulations, members of the previous OSU mailing list who do not re-subscribe with SGN, will no longer be able to receive news, updates and event invitations from us after April 2020.

### As an individual, what can I look forward to by connecting with SGN?
