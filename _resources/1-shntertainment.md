We know that it is not easy to be indoors, and never in our wildest imaginations did we expect that in Singapore, we aren't able to eat out, or even go to our friends’ houses. But with the escalating covid-19 pandemic, we all have to play a part in keeping Singapore safe, and that is to STAY HOME. We have put together this page, to hopefully keep you entertained during your SHN period and through these circuit breaker measures. Keep checking back, we will try to update it as often as we can! THANK YOU for keeping us safe!

### <a id="kid-activities"></a> For the Kiddos

We know that being stuck indoors with kids for 14 days is no easy feat. Keeping the little ones entertained in the constrains of your home, we are here to help the best we can! We have put together some resources to keep the kids busy!

##### Home Based Learning

The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) have gathered Home-based Learning Activities and Resources designed by preschools to share with you here every Monday, starting from 6 April 2020. These materials are designed specifically for infants to children in kindergarten. They come with clear instructions on what to do so you can easily carry them out at home. You can pick and choose what you think is suitable for your child, according to their age. Not only can your child learn, it is also a time for you to bond with your child through these activities!

#####	SGN Kids’ Resources

Why not read them a book - like our very own SG version of the Great Zodiac Race [here](https://www.singaporeglobalnetwork.com/resources/resources-for-kids/#great-zodiac-race) or have them check out our hidden gems in Singapore [here](https://www.singaporeglobalnetwork.com/resources/resources-for-kids/#sg-hidden-gems) so that you can plan on where to go after covid is over! 

You can also give creativity a go by getting crafty! This pop up cityscape of [Singapore](https://www.singaporeglobalnetwork.com/resources/resources-for-kids/#sg-cityscape) will give you and your kids a chance to bond creatively!
