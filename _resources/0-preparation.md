## Security Regulations

There are certain items you should not carry with you when leaving the country. These include illegal drugs, dangerous goods such as explosives and flammable chemicals/materials, lethal weapons and firearms. You may refer to the Changi Airport website for the list of prohibited items. Controlled items such as chemicals, rough diamonds, meat products and radioactive materials will require proper authorisation (application of an export licence/advance notification or certificate approval) from the various Competent Authorities.

Please refer to the Singapore Customs website for the list of controlled and prohibited goods for export and their corresponding Competent Authorities.

If you’re bringing medication with you, check if it contains controlled substances. All personal medication should be properly labelled to facilitate security clearance at the respective checkpoints. Your doctor’s prescription letter would be helpful.  

Depending on which country you are heading to, these may include items such as films, tapes and books. For import regulations, seek the advice of the embassy of your destination country well in advance.

## Export of Pets

There are export requirements for pets travelling out of Singapore. All exports of personal animals are regulated by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA). You are required to abide by AVA's export licence and pets quarantine requirements. Additional permits are required if the pet is a CITES-listed species.
