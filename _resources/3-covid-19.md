On 9 March, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte extended measures to tackle Covid-19 across the whole country – telling citizens to “stay at home”.

Announced in an evening television address, PM Conte elaborates that “the whole of Italy will become a protected zone” and that “all movement across the country is to be avoided unless motivated by three specific circumstances – reasons of work, reasons of necessity or health reasons”. The measures will come into effect beginning 10 March.

The national restriction will run until 3 April, and all schools and universities will immediately close. Travel in and out of the country, as well as movement between cities, will be restricted.

Mainland China has seen a decline in locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, with most cases only occurring within the Hubei province. The health authority remains to be on alert for infections arriving from abroad.

While the domestic spread has significantly slowed, Chinese authorities continue to be mindful of risks stemming from both foreigners and Chinese nationals travelling back to China from affected regions.

Shanghai has stepped up airport screening over from 7 March as imported infections from countries such as Italy and Iran emerged as the biggest source of imported cases in the country. China is also conscious of the tens of millions of migrant workers returning to offices, malls and factories and the potential transmission risks.
